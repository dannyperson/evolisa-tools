evolisa-tools
=============
The original C# Genetic Vectorizer can be used to make lots of cool vector graphics, but it misses some features to really help that move along.

The orignal EvoLisa tool is here: http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/11/genetic-programming-mona-lisa-source-code-and-binaries/

This repo is for scripts and tools that make pretty SVGs and big art easier to make.
